# infocomm-toolbox
    This library provides standard-compliant functions and reference examples for the modeling, simulation, and verification of communications systems. 
#### This library allows you to:
* Generate QAM/PM signals, as well as set and build signal constellations.
* Simulate the presence of white Gaussian noise in the channel
* Use convolutional encoding as well as Viterbi decoder
